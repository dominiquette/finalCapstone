# Task Manager

## Description
This project serves as the final capstone for the HyperionDev bootcamp. The aim was to refine and extend the functionality of a basic task management system originally implemented in 'original_task_manager.py'. The resulting application, 'task_manager.py', represents the enhanced and corrected version.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project was to leverage lists, dictionaries, and functions to augment the capabilities of a rudimentary task management system. Designed with small businesses in mind, the program facilitates task assignment and monitoring within a team. The focal point was on code refactoring, aimed at streamlining the code structure and improving readability to ease comprehension for other developers.
