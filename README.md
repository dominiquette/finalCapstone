# Task Manager

This project served as my final capstone during my tenure at the HyperionDev bootcamp. The task involved working with the 'original_task_manager.py' file, which was the original code I needed to correct and enhance. The result of my efforts is the 'task_manager.py,' representing the final version after updates and corrections.

The primary objective of this project was to utilize lists or dictionaries and functions to expand the capabilities of a basic task management system. The program was specifically crafted for small businesses, aiding in the management of tasks assigned to team members. The core focus was on evaluating my ability to refactor code — a process aimed at simplifying the code structure and enhancing team code readability, preventing challenges for other developers in understanding the code.

Prior to commencing the work, it was crucial to ensure the correctness, formatting, and readability of the code. This involved:

1. Identifying and rectifying all syntax, runtime, and logical errors in the code.
2. Organizing the code into modular functions, each performing specific units of work.
3. Enhancing code readability by incorporating comments, using descriptive variable names, and implementing effective whitespace and indentation.
4. Striving for code efficiency by choosing optimal writing styles for solving the specified problem.
5. Ensuring that the program's output is user-friendly, with clear labeling of all data presented to the user — be it in text files or on the screen. This emphasis on readability and user-friendliness was illustrated through comparisons of output readability in provided images, highlighting the impact of spacing and labeling on user experience.
